Hi, I’m Tanmay Sagar, a Master’s student in Quantitative Finance and Fintech at the University at Buffalo, passionate about driving innovation at the intersection of finance, technology, and data analysis. My academic journey has equipped me with expertise in financial modeling, data analytics, and cutting-edge technologies like blockchain and machine learning. Through rigorous coursework and hands-on projects, I’ve applied these skills to solve complex problems in risk assessment, portfolio optimization, and predictive modeling.

Before graduate school, I gained invaluable experience at BNY Mellon and AXA Business Services. At BNY Mellon, I conducted macroeconomic analysis and stress testing, improving credit risk strategies while reducing operational inefficiencies by 75% through process enhancements. At AXA Business Services, I delivered data-driven insights that supported high-impact decisions in risk and reconciliation management. These experiences strengthened my analytical and technical capabilities while enabling me to contribute to high-performing teams.

This portfolio showcases my ability to blend financial expertise with technical skills using tools like Python, SQL, Tableau, and Power BI. Each project demonstrates my commitment to leveraging innovation to solve real-world financial challenges.
